# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our group was interested in creating a database app to solve a problem that an organization might face, but also making the experience fun for the user. So we came to the consensus that we'd do an inventory-style app, but with a game-ified user interface! The project is called "Tea Shop Inventory: The Game". This is an app which keeps track of the inventory of a tea shop warehouse, but users use arrow keys to navigate a forklift around obstacles (people and other forklifts) to move tea off of delivery trucks and into the correct spaces in the warehouse. We will use database CRUD operations to track the status of inventory. We might also pull actual tea varieties from a website or API.
### Features
1) Add items to inventory
2) Remove items from inventory
3) Search for items in inventory
4) User login
### Technologies
- Java
- Spring Boot
- MySQL
- Angular or React (I think Myriam knows these well and the others said we could learn/freshen up on these for the front-end)
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn React for the front-end (if we go with that instead of Angular). I'll also need to learn how to pull from an API of tea varieties. I also don't know about how to build a small game-engine, but I know that Austin said he can provide one to us that we can then modify.
